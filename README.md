### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a programmer/security researcher who likes maintaining filter lists for uBlock Origin, finding malware, and writing Python. I am very good at breaking things, but not as good at fixing things I have broken. <br/>
My personal uBlock Origin filters are at https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001 <br/>
I also help maintain [Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/discussions/163). <br>
Pronouns: He/Him<br>
You can contact me as iam-py-test on GitHub and GitLab. I have [more contact methods listed on my website](https://iam-py-test.github.io/about.html).<br>
**Many of my projects are not actively maintained, always check the date of the last commit and verify the code still works**
