### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a programmer/security researcher who likes maintatining filter lists for uBlock Origin and reporting malware/bugs.<br/>
Because I am new to GitHub, please forgive me if I make an error <br/>
My personal uBlock Origin filters are at https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001 <br/>
Projects I have contributed to: [DandelionSprout/adfilt](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/issues/185) and [uBlockOrigin/uAssets](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/9117) <br/>
